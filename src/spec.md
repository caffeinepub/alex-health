# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the product to “Alex Health” and elevate both the landing page marketing and the post-login UI to feel professional, cohesive, and polished.

**Planned changes:**
- Update all user-facing product naming to “Alex Health” across the landing page, authenticated app shell (header/nav), and HTML metadata (including the page title and relevant alt text).
- Expand the unauthenticated landing page with professional, marketing-focused sections covering dieting and exercising, including concrete example plan formats (meal plan + workout plan) and a clear “plans + documentation” workflow description, while keeping a single primary login CTA.
- Apply a cohesive visual theme across landing and authenticated views (typography, spacing, card/button styling, accent color direction) to make the UI feel “really beautiful” without adding new features.
- Improve post-login usability and polish by refining navigation clarity (current section indication), layout hierarchy, and professional empty/loading states for key views on desktop and mobile.

**User-visible outcome:** The app consistently presents as “Alex Health,” the landing page better communicates dieting/exercise value with concrete examples, and after login the UI is easier to navigate and more visually polished with improved empty/loading states.
