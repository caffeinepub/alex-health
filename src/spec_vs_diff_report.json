  "summary": "Diff implements the Alex Health rebrand across key UI surfaces, adds a significantly expanded marketing landing page, applies a refreshed theme via global CSS tokens (incl. dark mode variables), and improves authenticated UI polish with clearer nav active states plus reusable empty/loading states. However, the requested image asset updates are not evidenced in the diff summary, and a couple of unrequested behaviors (toasts and a custom navigation event) were introduced.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Update the app icon to reflect the \"Alex Health\" brand (app-icon.dim_512x512.png > app-icon.dim_512x512.png).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows the icon being referenced in UI, but does not show any asset/binary change for the icon itself, so the requested image edit cannot be verified as implemented.",

      "reason": "The diff summary shows the banner being referenced, but does not include evidence of the hero banner image file being updated (binary/assets not shown).",
